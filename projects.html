				<h5 class="card-title">Work Projects</h5>
				<p class="card-text">I've worked on, and have been working on several projects while at Cox Automotive:</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
				<li class="list-group-item">I'm currently working on a Chatbot called 'Ask Kelley' that utilizes Natural Language Parsing, and will hopefully be debuting on KBB.com soon. Will add a link and more details when public though.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">I did a massive migration of my team's flagship service away from an old infrastructure stack of terraform code, deployed using Jenkins, onto Elastic Beanstalk, and onto AWS CDK, GitHub Actions, and AWS Fargate. This migration took several months of steady work, but led to reduced overhead costs of ~20%, and even reduced our API response times by ~10% as well.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Another big cost reduction project I did was consolidating different caching services we were using across our projects, into a single AWS MemoryDB cache. Aside from reducing our infrastructure complexity immensely, MemoryDB is saving my company approximately $9k/month compared to the other databases and caching tools we were using previously.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">One of the more visible projects I did was related to the 'My Wallet' tool on Autotrader.com and Kelley Blue Book. I was tasked with creating the Database for storing information related to this project, as well as the API service that the front-end uses to allow user interactions with it. You can read about <a href="https://b2b.autotrader.com/dealer-marketing/vehicle-listings/my-wallet/">MyWallet in this Autotrader Article</a></li>
				<li class="list-group-item">A big projects that's always ongoing with my team is expanding the notification suite at Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. I work on stuff like saved car searches, tracking price drops for selected vehicles, and various 're-engagement' emails for consumers browsing different sections of the sites.</li>

				<h5 class="card-title">School Projects</h5>
				<p class="card-text">I've completed several projects at KSU, let me tell you about a few of the more interesting ones:</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
				<li class="list-group-item">My Undergrad Senior project was a Medieval Chess game. We have an AI in the game that uses a Fuzzy Logic AI model, where the AI is actually split into three 'corps', led by the king and two bishops. Its able to be played in Player VS AI, or observing an AI VS AI match. We ended up being a finalist project at KSU's computing showcase day back in December 2020. If you want to learn more about this, or try it out, you can go to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231120185203/https:/chessai.netlify.app/">Netlify webpage one of my teammates setup to host it.</a></li>
				<li class="list-group-item">A research project I did for my Machine Learning class in Fall 2020 was trying to create a Machine Vision model that could identify various road signs and traffic lights.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">A simpler game project I did for my intro to Artificial Intelligence class in Spring 2020 was a checkers game with an AI opponent using a Minimax algorithm. You can download it to play at the GitHub link below!</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">The first project I did for my Masters degree was creating a basic social media app for my 'Emerging Software Engineering Processes' class in Summer 2024, where we were building the project while trying to follow Agile principles and development workflow.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">The other big project I've completed so far was a Unity game for my 'User Interaction Engineering' class in Fall 2024. It's a basic shoot-em-up game with two levels for users to play. This was suggested by a teammate who was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor:_Call_of_the_Shadows">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a>.</li>
