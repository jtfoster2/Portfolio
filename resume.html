				<h5 class="card-title">Work Experience</h5>
				<p class="card-text">I've been working for Cox Auto since September 2021, so approximately three and a half years now.</p>
				<p class="card-text">The team I work on primarily focuses on personalization and notifications, so my projects at work touch what gets recommended to you on Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book, but we also create the infrastructure that sends you email, text, or push notifications about various things you sign up for on the webpage too.</p>
				<p class="card-text">When I started out of college, I was a L1 Software Engineer, but I was promoted to Software Engineer L2 in February 2024, which encouraged me to come back to school for the Masters degree.</p>
